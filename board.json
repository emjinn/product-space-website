For example, I use it on my lock screen to show my reminders and the weather without having to open my phone. On my home screen I can add the Google Calendar and Spotify widgets to get a visual of what event is next or what I'm currently listening to. ",
            "WhyPS": "I joined Product Space because I was looking for hands-on experience that the classes I was taking didn't provide. As a first generation student, I lacked professional knowledge and guidance, so I hoped to find that here. Luckily, I was able to join and Product Space opened up so many people, resources, and skills up to me. I'm so glad I got the opportunity to meet everyone in the fellowship and build a community where we all support each other in our respective endeavors."
